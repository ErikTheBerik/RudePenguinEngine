What's a quaternion?
	a quaternion describes an objects rotation.

So why use a quaternion in place of a x, y and z rotation?
	Quaternion solves the problem with gimbal lock!
	It also makes interpolation between two orientations look a bit smoother.

But how do I use it?
	Just create it, and then use its rotate functions! Once it's rotated, you can use the GenerateMatrix function to get a matrix over the orientation.
